# Installation

 1. Python:
       * They need to install the Python programming language itself. They can download it from the official
         website: python.org (https://python.org)
       * During installation, it's important that they check the box that says "Add Python to PATH" (or a
         similar option). This allows them to run Python from any command prompt or terminal.


   2. The `pdfplumber` library:
       * After installing Python, they will need to install the specific module used in the script to read PDF
          files.
       * They can do this by opening a command prompt (or terminal) and running the following command:

    pip install pdfplumber
