# Installation

 1. Python:
       * You need to install the Python programming language itself. You can download it from the official
         website: python.org (https://python.org)
       * During installation, it's important that you check the box that says "Add Python to PATH" (or a
         similar option). This allows you to run Python from any command prompt or terminal.


   2. The `pdfplumber` library:
       * After installing Python, you will need to install the specific module used in the script to read PDF
          files.
       * You can do this by opening a command prompt (or terminal) and running the following command:

    pip install pdfplumber
